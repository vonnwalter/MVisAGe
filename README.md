# MVisAGe
A tool to model and visualize the cancer genome
High-profile studies such as those conducted by The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) have provided biomedical researchers unprecedented access to high-
quality genomic datasets. Unfortunately, even basic analyses can be difficult for
researchers without specialized bioinformatics skills. MVisAGe was designed
with this audience in mind, and the package allows users to easily perform bi-
variate analyses involving mRNA expression and another quantitative genomic
variable (e.g. DNA copy number data). As currently implemented, MVisAGe
does not perform any sort of hypothesis testing. Instead, MVisAGe allows
users to compute and visualize Pearson correlation coefficients on a regional or
genomewide basis with the goal of assessing the effect of a genomic alteration
(e.g. DNA copy number change) on gene expression.
